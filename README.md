# python-ppt-remote
This is a script to remote control PowerPoint presentations on Windows from your smartphone. 

Usage:
 * Run pptremoteserver.py on a server accessible from the internet
 * Run pptremoteagent.py on the computer where you have PowerPoint running
 * Open the pptremoteserver's IP address with your smartphone's browser and control the slideshow

      On server: flask
      On agent: keyboard, pywin32, requests
